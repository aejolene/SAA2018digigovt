<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Since passage of the National Historic Preservation Act fifty-three
years ago a growing body of valuable data has been generated by state
agencies, CRM professionals, and preservation officers. Unfortunately,
this data is usually trapped in an archaic paper-based format,
restricted geographically to a single state archive. All too often the
data is brought to light only to be “reburied” in the SHPO’s library
where it may be largely inaccessible to researchers scattered throughout
the country. This paper describes how the Maryland Historical Trust is
addressing this problem through the establishment of a secure, online,
searchable catalog of raw data and CRM reports.</p>
<p><strong>Defining “Gray Literature”</strong></p>
<p>Within Archaeology, a substantial body of print data exists in a form
typically classified by the library science community as “fugitive”
literature or more commonly by archaeologists as “gray” literature. A
considerable amount of time and attention has been dedicated to defining
what gray literature is, its strengths and weaknesses, and methods of
providing access to it (Warnick 2001, Denda 2002, Seely 2005, Stock and
Schöpfel 2003, Owen 1997, Harrison 2005, Schöpfel 2006). While the
defining characteristics of gray literature and the motives for creating
it are debated within the library community, the key factor that sets it
apart from traditional monographs or serial publications is the mode(s)
of distribution used. Alberani and De Castro (2001: 237) define gray
literature as, “material that is <em>not</em> circulated through the usual
commercial channels, <em>not</em> easily found, <em>not</em> always available, etc.”.
Commercial publishers are not involved in the dissemination of gray
literature. Any form of profit typically takes a back seat in the effort
to distribute the material and, thus, access to such literature can be
difficult or nearly impossible. At any rate, access does not come
through the “normal” avenues of bookseller, journal subscription, or
library.</p>
<p>Research librarians have pointed out that obtaining comprehensive
information on specific archaeological sites is a particularly
challenging issue for them, in large part because of the proliferation
of gray literature within our field (Seely 2005: 2, Adelman and Markson
1987). If this is a problem for research librarians, then surely it is a
problem for the community of archaeologists. Dr. Dean Snow, former
President of the Society for American Archaeology lamented as recently
as 2010 that despite the proliferation of a number of useful online
tools providing access to archaeological data in recent years, vast
troves of unpublished CRM reports remain inaccessible or very difficult
to access (2010: 350).</p>
<p>In the United States, this state of affairs has been exacerbated by the
growth in research driven by compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (Snow, et al. 2006, Lattanzi 1999, Childs and
Corcoran 2000) and similar state laws, and now even local ordinances in
some areas. Publically-funded archaeology has also produced a similar
proliferation of gray literature in other parts of the world (Adelman
and Markson 1987, Cohen, Murowchick and Kao 2018). Unfortunately, this
data is often restricted geographically to one or a few government
archives in a given state. In the United States, the State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO) that reviews CRM work usually becomes the
final repository for compliance-driven archaeological reports. Any given
SHPO’s library is often inaccessible to researchers scattered throughout
the country, resulting in the effective “reburial” of archaeological
data that has only recently come to light.</p>
<p>Another factor in the proliferation of gray literature is a dramatic
expansion in the scope of the data that archaeologists recover.
Innovation in data recovery and analysis methods have made the recovery
of ethnobotanical remains, animal bone, debitage, sherdlets, and other
materials a part of routine recovery, while archaeologists of an earlier
era would have discarded or overlooked these materials. As a
consequence, “[t]he level of documentation now demanded by our
discipline impedes the function of the publication process as a tool to
preserve the archaeological record” (Kansa 2005: 98). The result is that
less and less data is being disseminated through traditional publication
channels and more is being consigned to gray literature or is not
circulated at all. This adds to the sheer volume of gray literature and
with no ready method by which to cull through it in pursuit of a
particular research topic, synthesis and data integration become next to
impossible (Kansa 2005: 98, Snow 2010: 352).</p>
<p><strong>Gray Literature and Archaeological Synthesis</strong></p>
<p>The explosive growth of gray literature, particularly compliance-driven
research reports, creates some serious problems for regional
archaeological synthesis and study of specific research questions.
Synthesis of archaeological research is built upon past experience. But
what happens when a given researcher’s sphere of “past experience” is
skewed towards data that has been generated through one process (i.e.
academic or grant-funded research) at the expense of another (compliance
driven work)? The “big picture” gets warped! The only way for
archaeologists to begin drawing accurate conclusions is if data from the
past is readily available from both “pure research” and “compliance”
perspectives (Bradley 2006). In addition, data generated as a result of
compliance-driven research is publically-funded. This data was largely
collected at the public’s expense, but if it is not incorporated into
syntheses of archaeological research, it remains inaccessible to the
public (Snow 2010: 352, Lawrence, et al. 2014: 3).</p>
<p>In 1998, a survey was conducted by the Council for British Archaeology
in which both archaeologists and lay readers were questioned about why
archaeological project publications and archives were being
under-utilized in the British Isles. The results of that survey
pinpointed the boom in archaeological gray literature as one of the most
pressing issues. There, as in the United States, this “boom” has been
largely generated by CRM research (what is called “developer-funded”
research in Britain). The survey revealed that many researchers simply
did not consult such literature and, “that those others who might wish
to use it are often not doing so, chiefly because of their unawareness
of its existence or difficulties of access” (Jones, et al. 2001: 6.2.2).
This survey was conducted during a period of explosive growth in
Internet technologies and the potential that these new technologies held
for solving the problem of access did not go unnoticed in Britain.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the survey, a consortium composed of the Council for
British Archaeology, several British universities, and other agencies
began working to provide online access to archaeological gray literature
through the Archaeology Data Service portal (ADS 2018). This valuable
resource provides free access to summary site reports that have been
uploaded by participating CRM professionals, academics, and governmental
agencies. In addition, data archives, scanned library resources, and
even online data analysis tools are made available free to the public -
all searchable via web-based applications. Millions of archaeological
site and monument records from throughout the British Isles have been
uploaded into the ADS databases and the service’s <em>ADS Library</em> includes
links to nearly 300,000 bibliographic records, including scanned site
reports (ADS 2018). While the Archaeology Data Service does not offer
complete coverage (participation is voluntary), it is a far more
comprehensive effort than has been implemented in the United States. The
influential British prehistorian, Richard Bradley, criticized the apathy
of many of his colleagues towards developer-funded (i.e. CRM) research,
stating that any synthesis of archaeological knowledge which ignores
such gray literature is bound to be erroneous (Bradley 2006). If
syntheses of British archaeology can be faulted, with ready availability
of CRM reports through the Archaeology Data Service, how much more
questionable must synthesis research in the United States be?</p>
<p>To be fair, it is not as if this problem is being ignored by American
archaeologists. Increasing numbers of researchers in the United States
are exploring the potential of Internet technologies to provide access
to archives of digital archaeological data. One can look back as early
as the 1980s, when National Park Service personnel began advocating for
the creation of a centralized database of bibliographic references for
archaeological work throughout the country. The National Archaeological
Database (NADB) was a compilation of over 350,000 bibliographic
references for research reports and analyses, a majority of which could
be classified as gray literature (CAST and NPS 2015).</p>
<p>The evolution of the Internet brought with it increasing calls for the
online publication of similar bibliographic reference lists, and also
the documents themselves. A growing number of publications and
conference presentations have begun to focus on issues of
“cyberinfrastructure” in archaeology (Kansa 2005, Snow, et al. 2006,
Kintigh 2006a, Kintigh 2006b, Snow 2010, Rivers Cofield and Reeves
Flores 2014, Kintigh et al. 2014). Many of these authors specifically
note the inadequacy of synthesis which does not take into account
“unpublished” data forms. They argue that the creation of
cyberinfrastructure would simultaneously preserve data and provide wider
access which would aide synthesis and lead to more accurate
archaeological interpretations in general.</p>
<p>And American archaeologists are putting their money (or at least their
creative energies) where their mouth is. The Archaeology Data Service in
Britain has already been mentioned, but in the mid-2000s, the ADS began
working with the Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies and a
consortium of universities, not-for-profit research institutes, and CRM
professionals calling itself “Digital Antiquity” (formerly
Archaeoinformatics.org) to produce an international cyberinfrastructure
for archaeology (Digital Antiquity 2018). This consortium has developed
software prototypes and infrastructures for preserving and providing
access to digital archaeological data such as text, images, GIS,
research databases, and the like. The tangible outgrowth of their work
has been the tDAR (the Digital Archaeological Record) database, which at
last check included over 390,000 document records (Brin 2018).</p>
<p>A number of smaller-scale efforts are also underway, focusing on more
restricted geographic areas or particular topics of interest. Boston
University’s International Center for East Asian Archaeology and
Cultural History, working with a broad consortium of Asian universities,
research institutes, museums, and cultural heritage agencies has been
building a database of bibliographic records for both published and
unpublished works of archaeological interest (Cohen, Murowchick and Kao
2018). A significant proportion of the records being incorporated into
the so-called “ARC/Base” database are government mandated site reports.
The quantity of such reports in East Asia is expected to grow rapidly in
the next few decades as new laws in China, Korea, and other Asian
countries begin to drive excavation in the same way North American
cultural resource management laws have driven research here (Cohen,
Murowchick and Kao 2018). Another example is the Museum of Underwater
Archaeology’s (MUA) Gray Literature Bibliographic Database. The MUA
project includes bibliographic references for Phase I and II submerged
resources reports, as well as redacted copies of the reports in some
instances. This database currently includes references for 296 reports
from 5 Atlantic seaboard states and a few federal agencies, but is
working to incorporate data from more states (MUA 2018). There are
numerous other examples scattered across the web of similar projects
focusing on particular subsets of data.</p>
<p>In recent years, a number of State Historic Preservation Offices have
taken steps to begin making state-curated archaeological data available
over the internet. A recent review of SHPO websites undertaken by the
author revealed that 24 states currently offer online access to some or
all of their site file data. Several others report that they are
currently working towards that goal. But of these 24 states, only half
(AR, DE, GA, IL, LA, MD, NM, NY, OR, PA, WA, and WY) appear to offer
some level of access to CRM site report data via the internet. Most of
these states provide access to either 1) a subset of the gray literature
reports available in the SHPO’s physical library, or 2) search
functionality for scanned CRM report abstracts or summary reports. Most
of the states either offer the archaeological data through a
password-protected website accessible only to professional
archaeologists, or through a paywall which helps to cover the costs of
maintaining the data. One state, Delaware, has scanned all of the gray
literature reports related to Department of Transportation projects and
made them freely available to the public, but the reports have been
heavily redacted to protect site location data.</p>
<p><strong>Obstacles to Online Gray Literature</strong></p>
<p>Before we see more widespread access to CRM gray literature data online,
a number of obstacles need to be overcome. First and foremost among
these is the now archaic format in which most of the gray literature
data has been collected: paper-based reports. While many SHPOs now
accept or even require the submission of CRM reports digitally for
review and compliance purposes, every state has a significant backlog of
print reports in their libraries.</p>
<p>In a geographically quite small state such as Maryland, the CRM backlog
consisted of approximately 3,700 reports just a few years ago. This
represents many hundreds of thousands of printed pages of data. With
such sheer volume at the outset, it can be daunting to contemplate how
to even begin addressing the problem. Though it is tempting to think
that improvements in the efficiencies and costs of scanning technologies
and optical character recognition software should allay concerns with
volume, state budgets typically prioritize existing programs over new
initiatives. On one level, it may be more practical and cost-effective
to build searchable databases that cover only the incoming gray
literature while ignoring the print backlog. However, it is not
sufficient. In order for true archaeological synthesis to take place,
databases need to be comprehensive and cover both print and
digitally-submitted reports.</p>
<p>Another major obstacle is the SHPOs’ responsibility to protect site
location data. Government employees are obligated under several pieces
of federal and, in many cases, state legislation to protect site
location data (Carnett 1991: 6-7). Obviously, this limits the ways in
which CRM report data can be provided to the public. However, as others
have noted (Snow 2010: 352), this data was collected at significant
public expense and there is also an ethical obligation to make the gray
literature data available to the public on at least some level. SHPOs
often find themselves caught in a tug-of-war between these two disparate
obligations. Again, this can lead to an unwillingness to tackle the
problem, or at the very least, uncertainty about how to go about doing
so.</p>
<p>Finally, the sheer volume of data contained in a typical CRM gray
literature report can be an obstacle in and of itself. In Maryland,
cultural resource management reports can routinely run upwards of 300
pages in length. Compare this to the typical gray literature report
available through the British Archaeological Data Service: while reports
sometimes do approach 300 pages in length, the vast majority appear to
be 30 or fewer pages.</p>
<p>The reasons for this disparity are the subject of an entirely different
paper, but the bulk of CRM reports in the US can actually be an
impediment to research. Investigators tend to have a fairly narrow topic
of interest in mind. Even if a given researcher is able to locate a
report of potential interest, the manuscript may be so large that it is
not easily digestible. Having read thousands of these reports, I suggest
that perhaps brevity is not valued highly enough in American
archaeology. It can be quite difficult to get a “feel” for a site when
so much of the really valuable data is being drowned out by “noise”.
Furthermore, locating the data of interest can be a
needle-in-the-haystack exercise when reports are so large.</p>
<p><strong>Solving the Gray Literature Problem(s)</strong></p>
<p>In 2007, the Maryland Historical Trust (MHT), the SHPO for the State of
Maryland, embarked upon an ambitious project aimed at synthesizing the
now 53 years of compliance-driven archaeological research conducted
within the state since inception of the National Historic Preservation
Act. Startup work was funded by a grant from the MHT Board of Trustees,
with additional funds coming later via Transportation Enhancement funds
administered by the Maryland State Highway Administration.</p>
<p>A major component of the Maryland Archaeological Synthesis Project has
been the generation of a searchable database of synopsis reports (think
expanded abstract). Additional products will eventually be overview
print and other media publications aimed toward the general public. The
development of the project database has been focused on providing both
the general public and the archaeological community with access to
Maryland’s archaeological gray literature data, while simultaneously
overcoming the three aforementioned obstacles: the paper backlog, report
volume, and site location data.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the paper backlog of gray literature reports
prior to the outset of the project consisted of some 3,700 gray
literature reports for both terrestrial and maritime archaeology
undertakings. Early on it was determined that online access to all of
these reports was not feasible, nor was it necessary. A majority of
these reports are Phase I survey and reconnaissance reports. While
clearly valuable data are present, most of the really critical data is
replicated in the Maryland Archaeological Site Survey Files that CRM
contractors complete when their reports are submitted to the state for
legal review and compliance. Sites that had only been subjected to Phase
I work were already well represented in MHT’s site files and a separate
project was underway to make the site files available to professional
archaeologists online (now live). For the Synthesis Project, effort
would instead be focused on sites which had been subject to Phase II
testing and Phase III data recovery efforts. The much more comprehensive
site data in these reports is not replicated in the MHT site files and
is also the data that is likely to be of the greatest interest to both
academic researchers and the general public.</p>
<p>While access to full site reports is desirable for certain purposes (and
MHT is working to make that possible), in the interest of data synthesis
it is often more useful to start with something smaller. Again, the size
of these reports can actually function as a hindrance to conducting
research. A researcher interested in any given topic is likely to have
dozens of print reports (each hundreds of pages long) to cull through,
before winnowing down to the handful of reports in which he or she may
actually be interested. While abstracts are helpful, they often do not
contain enough data to identify whether or not a particular site report
is worth examining further. The MHT’s synthesis project seeks to attain
a middle ground by generating “synopsis reports” or capsule summaries
that provide a snapshot of the most relevant data (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>A typical synopsis report distills the most relevant data into a
manageable, digestible and typically 3-6 page format. The synopsis
reports currently in the MHT synthesis database provide an overview of
all work conducted at the site (pulled from the original print reports
by MHT staff), location and environmental information, and aggregate
data tables of site features and artifacts organized in such a way that
researchers can quickly pull out the information most relevant for their
projects. Data is also pulled directly from the MHT archaeological site
survey files to provide more detailed reports. This strategy not only
migrates the gray literature data from a paper-based format, but also
makes it more digestible. Once the researcher knows which sites are of
definite interest, they can then make arrangements to access the full
CRM report in the MHT library, and (we hope) eventually online.</p>
<p>Finally, site locations are protected within the Archaeological
Synthesis database by providing tiered access to these synopsis reports.
Two versions of the database have been made available online: a
password-protected version for archaeologists that meet the Secretary of
the Interior’s Professional Qualifications for Archaeologists, and an
open-access version for the general public. The data available in both
versions are identical with the exception of three fields: <em>Site
Setting</em>, <em>Latitude</em>, and <em>Longitude</em>. <em>Site Setting</em> for professionals
typically provides a brief description of the local environment and
often detailed instructions on how to locate the site. <em>Latitude</em> and
<em>Longitude</em> represent the centroid of the site area polygon from our
in-house Geographic Information System. On the public side of the
database, <em>Latitude</em> and <em>Longitude</em> are randomized to within one square
mile of the actual site location and <em>Site Setting</em> is entirely
restricted. MHT feels that this strategy provides an appropriate
compromise between protecting site location information and providing
the public with the data collected at their expense.</p>
<p>The Archaeological Synthesis Project is online at <a href="https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/synthesis/">https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/synthesis/</a>. The synopsis report data
is archived in SQL Server where it is keyword searchable via a web
interface. Researchers don’t have to have a particular site in mind when
performing a search, and thus, their past experience is no longer a
limitation to data synthesis. In addition, the database can be queried
by site name, trinomial number (or partial number), Maryland
Archaeological Research Unit, Soil types, and other variables (see
Figure 2). Each query points to any number of “hits”, and each hit
points to an URL for the site synopsis report in Adobe PDF format.</p>
<p>Each hit also points to an URL for a reference cover sheet which is
prepared to summarize the various projects (compliance or otherwise)
that were responsible for the generation of information on a site or a
given group of sites (e.g., highway widening, undergraduate fieldschool,
construction of a prison, real estate development, etc.). The project
cover sheet summarizes the purpose for the archaeological work
undertaken, the archaeological research questions asked, and other
useful information. It also provides an assessment by MHT as to whether
the site is likely to retain any additional research potential. An
example of a typical reference cover sheet is provided in Figure 3.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The Archaeological Synthesis Project went live on the web on Maryland
Day (March 25^th^), 2015. Since then, the project has proven its
usefulness in responding to the periodic email and phone requests MHT
receives from library patrons with specific research topics in mind.
According to senior MHT staff, question responses which once would have
taken a week or more of library research work to answer, can now be
responded to in a matter of minutes. This is over and above the everyday
queries that our patrons can now make on their own (again, significantly
reducing the workload on MHT staff). In addition, the synthesized data
will help redirect future investigations to examine data gaps, provide
readily accessible comparative data to enable informed National Register
evaluations, and focus research questions to target important issues for
data recovery efforts.</p>
<p>MHT’s Office of Preservation Services staff use the database on a daily
basis in their review of submitted projects for their impacts on
archaeological resources in accordance with both federal and state
historic preservation law (Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 and the Maryland Historical Trust Act of 1985).
Through the ability to search the database on a regional or statewide
basis and the detailed information presented in the accompanying
synopsis reports, staff are able to make informed and justifiable
decisions much more efficiently and accurately. The types of decisions
routinely made with the assistance of the Synthesis database include the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>determining the level of effort necessary for a given investigation
    based on results from previous studies as well as data gaps for a
    particular region, time period or site type;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating sites for National Register eligibility &amp; placing them
    within an appropriate context;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying relevant research questions to focus data recovery and
    produce useful results; and;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>helping to define appropriate mitigation measures (through
    traditional or creative means) to compensate for adverse effects to
    a significant site.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One recent example involved a proposed project that had the potential to
impact surviving sections of an archaeological site that was originally
investigated and partially excavated over 30 years ago. The Birely
Tannery site (18FR575) was originally identified during planning for the
Carroll Creek flood control project during the 1970s and 1980s,
determined eligible for the National Register, and portions of the site
were excavated in 1990 prior to its destruction by the flood control
project. The data recovery investigations (Thomas et al. 1991) examined
numerous archaeological features and midden areas associated with
various aspects of the tannery operations during the 19th and early 20th
centuries. While portions of the site were destroyed for the flood
control project, archival information indicated that the site originally
extended beyond the boundaries of that specific project.</p>
<p>When a construction project subject to MHT review was proposed in this
area, staff queried the Synthesis Project database to quickly anchor
themselves in the archaeological “milieu” surrounding the site. It can
be difficult to quickly and efficiently get a handle on past
archaeological work at a site, on work at other sites in the region, on
sites of comparable research value and interest, and on sites in similar
environmental settings without such a tool. The MHT staff quickly
discovered that the Birely Tannery site (18FR575) constitutes the sole
tannery site in Maryland that has been professionally investigated at
the Phase II/III level and found to yield substantive and comprehensive
information regarding this important industry throughout the 19th and
into the mid 20th century. MHT staff recommended Phase I/II
archaeological investigations which revealed Site 18FR575 extended into
the impact area for the new construction. The new investigations
identified the remains of 13 tannery related features including: four
tanning pits, one waste pit, stone paving, and the remains of several
structural foundations. The site still contains buried surfaces and
features that survive beneath the various fill and disturbance actions
that have occurred on the site during the mid to late 20th century.
These newly discovered resources represent the site’s continuation into
the project area, as expected, and contain an important record of the
history, development and operations of the Birely Tannery.</p>
<p>Increasingly, MHT staff are seeing that archaeological consulting firms
are making use of the Archaeological Synthesis database to perform
background research and inform recommendations. In October of 2017, a
Phase II study was carried out at the Jones Farm (18QU1052) in Queen
Anne’s County prior to installation of a solar power generation complex
(Petyk 2017). The solar installation project was to be located on a
tract that was consistently used by tenant farmers, but owned by
absentee landlords dating back to at least the last quarter of the 18th
century. Ceramics recovered during the Phase II excavations on the farm
provided a mean ceramic date of 1802 for the site and also suggested a
relatively low economic status for the site’s occupants. The Phase II
investigation also identified the presence of an intact feature (likely
a cellar) near the center of the site, indicating that the farm retained
good integrity and might contain additional features associated with the
late 18th to early 19th-century occupation of the property. The Phase II
report notes that while, tenancy was a common practice in Queen Anne’s
County during the 18th and 19th centuries, examination of the
Archaeological Synthesis database revealed this type of site has been
largely understudied in the county and throughout the Eastern Shore of
the state. No 18th century tenant occupations in Queen Anne’s County
have been subjected to Phase II investigations, and only one other site
(in Talbot County) has been evaluated at the Phase II level. That site
was found to have been heavily impacted by modern disturbances.</p>
<p>Following MHT’s review of these findings and the results of the Phase II
background research, staff concurred that site 18QU1052 does indeed
possess good integrity and unique research potential and was therefore
eligible for inclusion in the National Register. MHT staff also
concurred with the recommendation that the site should be avoided during
construction and preserved in place, an arrangement that the solar
installation firm agreed to. The site was avoided by providing a
30-meter buffer from the site boundary and installing protective fencing
and signage.</p>
<p>Finally, the Archaeological Synthesis Project is also providing
opportunities for MHT staff in the Office of Research, Survey, and
Registration to step back and explore data gaps, research priorities,
development of predictive modeling, and other topics that they have
heretofore been unable to consider. Figures 4 and 5 are from a recent
analysis performed on the Archaeological Synthesis dataset to explore
sites with Late Archaic components that have been examined at the Phase
II or III level. In this case, a report was run to look only at the data
from one area: Dorchester County, Maryland. The report could have as
easily been run looking at a specific physiographic province, watershed,
or a different time period. The point is that the Office of Research now
has a tool in place (the Archaeological Synthesis Database) to begin
looking at patterns in the data and plan research priorities
accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Gray literature has been vexing to whole generations of archaeologists
now that we are 53 years on since passage of the National Historic
Preservation Act. That legislation has focused intense time and energy
on the collection of data with less attention paid to how that data
would be made available so that it could inform decision-making and be
interpreted for the public. But innovative new technologies are
beginning to bridge the gap between traditional published data sources
and less-widely distributed archives of archaeological information.</p>
<p>The Maryland Historical Trust is at the forefront of this innovation,
working towards technologies that will permit rapid and ready access to
the archaeological information that we have at our disposal. With an eye
towards the future, we are attempting to design these technologies in
such a way that they can work seamlessly with other innovative projects
and as yet unimagined technologies. The end result will be a new era in
archaeology where the first true synthesis of all archaeological data,
both the research conducted in academia and the tremendous amount of
work completed by CRM professionals, becomes possible.</p>
