summary: Session details, abstracts, and opportunities to contribute

-----------------

This session is an electronic symposium at the 2018 [Society for American Archaeology Conference](http://saa.org/AbouttheSociety/AnnualMeeting/tabid/138/Default.aspx) on Saturday, April 4 at 8am. As an electronic symposium, the format is a bit different than regular sessions. Full papers won't be read during the two hour session, but we'll have time to discuss materials gathered on the web. The session is sponsored by SAA's [Digital Data Interest Group](https://twitter.com/SAA_DDIG).  


### Abstract

Within the public sector, archaeologists and our agencies use a range of technologies to “do” archaeology in support of heritage management laws and mandates, thereby producing digital data. We are also faced with curating large volumes of digital media and datasets created by others. The quantity of data and speed of change pose challenges in making information useful and accessible internally, to researchers, the private sector, and the general public. But these factors also introduce new opportunities for understanding the material record and conveying its value. Where are we now at various levels of government service and public outreach? Where do we hope to go? How can we collaborate across geopolitical boundaries? What would we build if we were free of financial and technological constraints? This electronic symposium will explore the possibilities, along with friction points and unintended consequences of the digital deluge through demonstrations, case studies, and discussion.


## Outside Contributors

Most (but not all!) contributors are government employees. We realize that not everyone will be able to secure time or funding to travel to the SAA meeting in Washington, DC, but we want to create a space for people to participate if they can. Do you have a digital accomplishment to share? Are you working through challenges to find data solutions? Please contribute! We intend to create a very big tent for exchange of ideas. "Government" can mean federal/national, tribal, state, province, or locality. The discussion is certainly welcoming to perspectives beyond the U.S.
