&lt;p&gt;For over a century, the National Park Service (NPS) has worked to preserve natural and cultural resources in more than four hundred park units for future generations.  In addition, the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requires all federal agencies to maintain inventories of their historic properties.  For decades, the NPS has relied upon three inventory systems: The List of Classified Structures, the Cultural Landscapes Inventory (CLI), and the Archeological Sites Management Information System (ASMIS). These systems began decades ago as paper files and continue today as electronic databases accessed via the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inventories allow NPS to maintain and update critical information including resource type, location, condition, threats, and disturbances.  As the relevant technologies continue to develop with what seems like increasing rapidity, even these relatively modern databases are being rapidly rendered obsolete.  The NPS Cultural Resources, Science, and Partnerships directorate has begun work to modernize these systems, and to facilitate their further integration with GIS technologies and other NPS programs, and incorporate elements of the now defunct Ethnographic Resources Inventory (ERI).  This paper discusses the issues faced as NPS updates these crucial tools for a second century of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m David Gadsby. I work in the Cultural Resources, Science and Partnerships Office of the National Park Service, where I coordinate our inventory database of archeological resources. We’re currently working to modernize our inventory systems that track information about historic buildings, cultural landscapes, ethnographic resources and archeological sites, and streamline them into a new online system. You’re looking at the ruins of Casa Grande National Monument. The ruins date to 1400s, protected through citizen activism and presidential proclamation, 1892, declared a national monument in 1918. This is an archeological site -- CAGR00014,  with a subsite. The site includes historic and Hohokam features (incl. a drainage ditch excavated by Jesse Fewkes during 1906 stabilization).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also more than one historic structure LCS 06607(shelter) On the national register – Designed by Olmsted Co.  and Thomas Vint, 01044 (Compound A) (Classic Hohokam, Also on NR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a cultural landscape – including the visitor center, Casa Grande itself and surrounding vegetation plan – part of a master plan from the 1930s.&lt;br&gt;
In addition to buried archaeological deposits and standing structures, there are facilities (like the walkways) and interpretive signage, not to mention natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a park resource management perspective, this is a fairly complex situation, with a large number of resources and resource values packed into a relatively small physical space. It is also repeated at different scales and in different configurations across the seven regions and 417 national park units.  Creating a resource inventory system that meets NPS’s diverse and complex needs presents a number of challenges.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists are busy all the time. Often stretching to meet a variety of professional obligations.  CRM and government agency archaeologists are among the most stretched given the different directions that pull upon their professional lives. Scholarly pursuits; administrative, bureaucratic, regulatory, and public outreach responsibilities related to physical sites and collections, easily fill or over-fill their schedules. Now the care and curation of digital data adds to the piling up of responsibilities. Digital data and the technical tools that create and enable its use present many opportunities for research and resource management. Digital technology makes data easily and widely accessible, sharing information, and enabling the creation of new interpretations and increase in overall knowledge. But, digital data must be curated or it will be lost. Digital curation doesn’t just happen, it requires attention, special expertise, and long-term commitment to the curation enterprise. The Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR) is a repository where individual archaeologists, agencies, and organizations deposit their data (e.g., documents, images, data sets, and more). Once deposited in tDAR the data are curated by digital archival specialists who focus on ensuring the data are protected, made available as the depositor determines, and kept available for use and re-use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="data"></category><category term="repositories"></category><category term="curation"></category></entry><entry><title>Always Halfway There: Keeping Up with Digital Archaeological Data in Virginia</title><link href="https://aejolene.github.io/SAA2018digigovt/halfway-smith-abstract.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jolene Smith</name></author><id>tag:aejolene.github.io,2018-02-19:/SAA2018digigovt/halfway-smith-abstract.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="jolene.smith@dhr.virginia.gov"&gt;Jolene Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since being one of the first State Historic Preservation Offices to adopt electronic records management in the late ‘80s, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources has worked through several iterations of databases and web applications. These systems manage basic site information, details about physical collections, and now digital media and datasets themselves. Over time, the agency’s priorities and objectives surrounding digital records and data have evolved in ways common to other institutions. As the most recent web GIS and database application reaches mid-life after four years, a thorough assessment of current and ideal approaches to digital data curation, preservation, and distribution is coming due as planning begins for what comes next. Building from concepts in libraries and archives, informatics, and data science, this presentation explores possible road maps.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="data"></category><category term="inventory"></category></entry><entry><title>10 years, 3 Supervisors, 7 assistants and 30 students.

&lt;p&gt;Sustainable accessible data storage is as important to archaeologists as tractors are to farmers.  In 2001 the Iowa Office of the State Archaeologist, (OSA), was archiving 20GB of data on a 100GB server.  16 years later the office is serving 32TB on several server systems and plans are in place to archive 60TB over the next 4 years.  In addition to space needs the office must also make this data in its many forms accessible to outside entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the not so distant past archaeologists secured and stored paper, photos and film in Hollinger boxes stacked to the ceilings in many places.  These days many archaeological agencies have scanned and archived massive amounts of data to server systems which takes up less space and can contain many times more data.  The OSA has taken advantage of many grants to scan and archive over 400,000 sheets of paper and 58,853 photos and slides.  The advantage of this undertaking; accessibility and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving into the future the OSA must develop and plan for the security storage and accessibility in ways that protect sensitive data.  Security is paramount in any organization but especially so when culturally sensitive data is in place.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="digitization"></category><category term="archives"></category><category term="sensitive-data"></category></entry><entry><title>Can you make me a map?

&lt;p&gt;Principle 6 of the Society of American Archaeology’s Principles of Archaeological Ethics emphasizes archaeologists’ responsibility to publically report archaeological investigations with the stipulation that “An interest in preserving and protecting in situ archaeological sites must be taken in to account when publishing and distributing information about their nature and location.” This paper first provides a critical review of current geolocation sharing recommendations and practices, and then describes available methods for dealing with sensitive location data and suggested best practices. Particular attention is paid to geomasking techniques, which communicate observed spatial relationships while obscuring sensitive geographic coordinates. Currently, only two geomasking techniques are widely used in archaeology: aggregating archaeological site locations into grids or administrative units, or placing points that represent site locations at a particular distance from their true locations. These techniques, while useful, are part of a larger and growing suite of tools that visually convey spatial data without revealing sensitive site locations. Principle 6 allows researchers flexibility in tailoring methods of communicating site locations, which is useful given the range of archaeological contexts. However, this work encourages researchers to responsibly exercise that flexibility by incorporating archaeological and environmental data into an explicit decision-making process for representing those places.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="gis"></category><category term="sensitive-data"></category></entry><entry><title>Managing Digital Data at the North Carolina Office of State Archaeology: Challenges and Directions</title><link href="https://aejolene.github.io/SAA2018digigovt/nc-blewitt-abstract.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Rosemarie Blewitt</name></author><id>tag:aejolene.github.io,2018-02-19:/SAA2018digigovt/nc-blewitt-abstract.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="rosemarie.blewitt@ncdcr.gov"&gt;Rosemarie Blewitt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Office of State Archaeology (OSA) was created by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1973 to coordinate and implement a statewide archaeological preservation program. Central to this program is the OSA’s management of records, including those documenting the more than 50,000 archaeological sites located in the state’s 100 counties, and a library of nearly 8,000 associated reports. The OSA Research Center curates tens of thousands of artifacts and their associated records from across North Carolina.
While there are computer databases for the site forms, bibliographic entries, maps, and artifacts, there is variability in the extent to which all records have been added to these databases. Arduous and labor intensive, the process of digitizing our records has evolved with the available technology and been limited by staffing. Our goal is to have this data in GIS and electronic databases accessible to researchers and easy to query.

&lt;p&gt;American archaeology is conducted under cultural resources protection laws, but how does archaeology meet the challenge of openness? The past decade saw development of the “open government” digital information paradigm for public availability of information that underpins the functions of governance. Open government data provide a base for the interested public to offer expertise in aspects of necessary analyses, and to derive further public value from reuse of government data in novel ways. The open government concept has affected the practice and communication of scientific data in regulatory regimes as far flung as climate science, health science, and archaeology, among many others. In 2007 the “eight principles of open government” were coined by a group of public advocates, followed rapidly by a mosaic of federal, state, and local initiatives. The Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) is a completely free, big data, open government data project, centered at several public institutions; DINAA embodies open government practices to develop a novel linked-open data network of archaeological site primary data and related records across the internet. Our disciplinary capacity to engage with the principles of open government will be addressed through DINAA interoperability assessments and experiments with open government data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="open-government"></category><category term="data"></category><category term="LOD"></category></entry><entry><title>The Maryland Archaeological Synthesis Project: One State’s Solution to Archaeology’s Crushing Gray Literature Problem</title><link href="https://aejolene.github.io/SAA2018digigovt/synthesis-mcknight-abstract.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-19T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Matthew McKnight</name></author><id>tag:aejolene.github.io,2018-02-19:/SAA2018digigovt/synthesis-mcknight-abstract.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="matthew.mcknight@maryland.gov"&gt;Matthew McKnight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since passage of the National Historic Preservation Act fifty-two years ago a growing body of valuable data has been generated by state agencies, CRM professionals, and preservation officers. Unfortunately, this data is usually trapped in an archaic paper-based format, restricted geographically to a single state archive. All too often the data is brought to light only to be “reburied” in the SHPO’s library where it may be largely inaccessible to researchers scattered throughout the country. This paper describes how the Maryland Historical Trust is addressing this problem through the establishment of a secure, online, searchable catalog of raw data and CRM reports.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="CRM"></category><category term="gray-literature"></category></entry></feed>
