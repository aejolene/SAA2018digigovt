#Futures and Challenges in Government Digital Archaeology

####A proposed electronic symposium for the 83rd Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, Washington, DC

#####Chair: Jolene Smith, Virginia Department of Historic Resources  

*Abstract* 

Within the public sector, archaeologists and their agencies are not only using technologies to “do” archaeology, thereby producing digital data. They are also faced with curating large volumes of digital media and datasets created by others. The quantity of information and speed of change pose challenges in making information useful and accessible to researchers, the private sector, and the public. But these factors also introduce new opportunities for understanding the material record and conveying its value.

Where are we now? Where do we hope to go? What would we build if we were free of financial and technological constraints? This electronic symposium will explore the possibilities, along with friction points and unintended consequences of the digital deluge through demonstrations, case studies, and discussion.
